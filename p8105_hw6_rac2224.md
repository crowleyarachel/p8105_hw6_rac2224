## Problem 1

Loading and cleaning the data for regression analysis

``` r
bwt_data = read_csv("data/birthweight.csv") %>%

  - baby\_sex, mother\_race, father\_race, and malformations were
    converted from numeric to factor variables. There were no missing
    values across all variables in the dataset.

Building regression models

  - For the proposed regression model for birthweight, the following
    variables were included in the model as predictors, based on
    existing literature that support an associaton between these factors
    and birthweight: average number of cigarettes smoked per day during
    pregnancy (smoking\_during\_pregnancy), mother’s age at delivery in
    years (mother\_age), mother’s pre-pregnancy BMI
    (pre\_pregnancy\_bmi), and gestational age in weeks
    (gestational\_age). It is hypothesized that for an one unit increase
    in the average number of cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy,
    birthweight will decrease; for an increase in age at delivery in
    years, birthweight will decrease; for a one unit increase in
    mother’s pre-pregnancy BMI, birthweight will increase; for an
    increase in gestational age in weeks, birthweight will increase.

\*When modeling residuals against fitted values for the proposed
regression model, the residuals are scattered far away from the line
where residuals (y) equals 0, indicating high variance and difference
between observed and predicted values with this model.

  - When modeling residuals against fitted values for the regression
    model with head size, length, and sex interaction and for the
    regression model with baby length and gestational age main effects,
    the residuals are closer to the line where residuals equals zero
    (y=0), indicating less variance with these models compared to the
    proposed model above. These models still have residuals that are far
    away from 0, thus variance is still moderately high with these
    models. The model with baby’s head size, length, and sex interaction
    appears to have the least variance of the three models, as residual
    values are closer to the line and fewer extreme values exist.

  - After plotting the prediction error distribution for each of the
    three models, the model with interaction by baby’s head size,
    length, and sex has a higher density at the smallest values of root
    mean squared error and best fit compared to the other models. The
    proposed model has the highest root mean squared error values and
    worst fit, while the model with baby length and gestational age main
    effects has slightly worse fit than the model with interaction
    terms.

linear regression and bootstrapping

Distribution of log(beta\_0\*beta\_1)

  - The distribution of log(beta\_0\*beta\_1) appears to have the form
    of a normal distribution, with the majority of points centered
    around a value of 2.016.

  - The 95% confidence interval for log(beta0xbeta1) is 1.965, 2.058,
    thus we are 95% confident that the true log(beta0xbeta1) lies
    between 1.965 and 2.058.

Distribution of r^2 estimates

  - The majority of r^2 estimates are centered around a r^2 value of
    .912 and the distribution appears approximately normal. The high
    density of values around .912 provides evidence that a large percent
    of the variation in tmax can be explained by tmin.

  - The 95% confidence interval for the r\_squared estimate is 0.893,
    0.927, thus we are 95% confident that the true r\_squared value lies
    between 0.893 and 0.927.
